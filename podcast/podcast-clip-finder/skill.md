description: Identify the best short-form clips from a podcast transcript for LinkedIn and YouTube Shorts/Reels. Shows exact timestamps, what to cut for conciseness, and platform-specific hooks. Optimized for 1 IDEA podcast — engineering-leader and senior practitioner audiences. Use when the user provides a transcript and wants shareable clips.

# Podcast Clip Finder

## Goal
Given a transcript (with or without timestamps), identify the 3–6 best clips for short-form video. For each clip, output:
- Where it starts and ends (timestamps or speaker cues if no timestamps)
- A concise edit — what to cut to get it under 60s
- A LinkedIn hook (caption + opening line)
- A YouTube hook (title for a Short/Reel)

Do not fabricate quotes. Ground every clip in actual language from the transcript.

## The Audience
Engineering leaders and senior practitioners: Staff and Principal Engineers, CTOs, VPs of Engineering, DevOps, SRE, Platform, Cloud, FinOps, infrastructure. They are skeptical of hype and respond to specificity. They skip anything that sounds like a keynote intro or vendor positioning.

## What Makes a Clip Worth Clipping

A clip lands when it contains one of:
- A concrete failure mode or hard-won lesson
- A counter-intuitive claim that a practitioner would argue with or share
- A sharp definition of something that's usually left vague
- A moment where the speaker names a tradeoff and commits to a side
- A decision the guest made that cost something
- A pattern engineers recognize from their own work

A clip does NOT land when it contains:
- Abstract framing with no payoff ("the future of AI is...")
- Motivational statements without evidence
- Episode context that only makes sense if you listened to the whole thing
- Long setups with the punchline cut off

## Working Process

### 1. Read the Full Transcript
Before flagging any clip, identify:
- The 3–4 recurring ideas in the episode
- The sharpest single claim (the most quotable sentence)
- The moments where the speaker's language gets specific — numbers, names, decisions, failures

### 2. Score Each Candidate Clip on Three Dimensions

**Standalone-ness (1–3):** Can someone understand it without having heard anything else?
- 1 = requires too much context
- 2 = marginal, could work with a tight intro
- 3 = fully self-contained

**Hook strength (1–3):** Does the first sentence make you want to keep watching?
- 1 = flat opener, builds slowly
- 2 = decent but not urgent
- 3 = immediately interesting — names a problem or makes a claim

**Specificity (1–3):** Does it use concrete language or generic language?
- 1 = mostly generic
- 2 = some specifics
- 3 = numbers, examples, names, or a precise claim

Select clips with total score ≥ 7. Include at least one clip per scoring tier (short ≤30s, medium 31–60s).

### 3. Draft the Edit
For each clip, specify:
- **Keep:** the core exchange or statement
- **Cut:** filler, false starts, lengthy setup, tangents that break standalone-ness
- **Target runtime:** under 60s is ideal; under 90s is acceptable if the payoff is strong

Be surgical. Do not recommend cutting a setup that the punchline depends on.

### 4. Write Platform Hooks

#### LinkedIn Hook
LinkedIn clips play without audio by default. The caption is the hook.

Structure:
```
[Single provocative sentence — the claim or failure in plain language]

[1–2 sentences of tension or stakes]

[Optional: short setup for the clip itself if context is needed]

Full episode: [leave blank — user fills in link]
```

Rules:
- First sentence must work as a standalone statement, not a teaser
- Do not use "In this clip..." or "Check out this video..."
- Do not use em-dashes as a crutch
- Avoid "game-changer," "unlock," "reimagine," "transform"
- Engineering audiences share posts that say something true, not posts that promise revelation

Good LinkedIn opener examples:
- Most AI failures are data failures, not model failures.
- Your agents won't save you if your on-call process is broken.
- The hardest part of AI in production isn't the model — it's the eval.
- We shipped a feature that reduced costs 40%. Nobody wanted to maintain it.

#### YouTube Short / Reel Title
Short, punchy, specific. 5–9 words max.

Rules:
- Must work without seeing the clip first
- Name the problem or the lesson — not the episode
- No clickbait questions unless the episode genuinely answers them

Good examples:
- Why AI Agents Break at Scale
- The Mistake Every Platform Team Makes
- AI Can't Fix a Broken On-Call Process
- What 40% Cost Reduction Actually Costs
- When to Stop Using Kubernetes

Weak examples:
- This Will Change How You Think About AI
- The Most Important Lesson I Learned
- You're Doing It Wrong

## Output Format

For each clip, output:

---
### Clip [N] — [2–4 word label, e.g. "The Data Problem"]

**Score:** [standalone / hook / specificity] = [total]

**Find it:**
> "[Opening words of the clip...]" → "[Closing words of the clip...]"
> Approx. [timestamp or page/paragraph reference if no timestamps]

**Runtime as-is:** ~[estimate]s

**Edit to [target]s:**
- Cut: [specific lines, tangents, or phrases to remove]
- Keep: [the core — starting with what line, ending with what line]

**LinkedIn caption:**
[Full caption, ready to paste]

**YouTube Short title:**
[Title]

---

Repeat for each clip. After all clips, add a section:

## Best Single Clip
Recommend which one clip to post first if the user has bandwidth for only one. State the reason in one sentence.

## Clip Variety Check
Note whether the set covers multiple angles (e.g., failure story, sharp definition, counter-intuitive claim). If three clips say the same thing in different ways, flag it.

## Style Rules

- Quote the transcript accurately. Do not paraphrase into something sharper than what was said.
- If you recommend a cut, explain why in one phrase — do not over-justify.
- Platform hooks should sound like the guest's voice, not a marketer's voice.
- Short-form content for this audience rewards specificity over energy. A calm, specific claim beats an enthusiastic vague one.
- Avoid hooks that promise "the real truth" or "what they don't tell you" — that pattern signals low-quality content to this audience.
